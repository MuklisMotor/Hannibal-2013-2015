    <p>Explores the early relationship between renowned psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter and a young FBI criminal profiler who is haunted by his ability to empathize with serial killers.

Jack Crawford pairs him with the astute psychiatrist Dr. Hannibal Lecter because his unique capacity for empathy with them compromises his sanity. Will has no idea that Lecter is a crafty cannibalistic killer who plays tricks on him and the FBI. As their twisted relationship develops, Lecter drives Will's sanity to the breaking point, erasing the distinction between hunter and hunted and ultimately compelling Will to face the darkness within him and the true nature of the man he believed to be his confidant.</p>
